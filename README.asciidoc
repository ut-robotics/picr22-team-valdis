== Programming


Bad: The code wasn't adaptable for different hardware, changes to the  electronics could cause the logic to completely fall apart. Can be improved upon by implementing more equations instead of hardcoding the different variables.

*Kevin Kirbits:* I worked mainly on the programming side and assisted a little on the manufacturing side. I learned that a lot of wasted time could be saved by looking at the resources from the previous years teams. 
What I would do differently if given the chance to do it all over again would be to plan my time more effeciently  and I would look more into the electronics part so i would be more well versed in all aspects of the robot. I liked that there was a lot to learn and don't have any criticisms about the idea of the course itself.
For students taking this course I would suggest planning your time accordingly and to be prepeared to spend more time with the robot than you allocated in your head. There are so many things that can go wrong or not work as intended. Something that you thought would be a 10 minute job can turn into a 2 hour endeavour.
For the instructors I would advise to gather more assistants to help especially for semesters when there are more teams participating. Inevitably nearing the deadlines everyone will want to present their work and it is understandable that you cannot reach everyone when there are many teams.

=== Friday 2022-11-04
*Karl:* Finished wheel design revision. Finished motor mount and camera mount (top and bottom plates are about 80% complete for initial design). Will get measurements for batteries and thrower voltage regulator over the weekend. Will also start work on an updated thrower design (current throw angle is a bit too steep). Completed new chassis design to be expected by Monday. Will also work on finishing schematic over the weekend to start work on PCB by next week. Also had idea for fixed battery sockets but won't concentrate on those at this time. (7h)

=== Sunday 2022-11-06
*Kevin and Arnold:* Did adjustments to the orbiting. Valdis will orbit around the ball until the ball is directly in the path of the basket. Once the adequate conditions are met valdis will pick up the ball and shoot. (Next up on the todo is to adjust the throwing angle and motor speed)(Also need to fix the startup ball finding procedure, if the robot sees no ball at initial startup the program will crash). (3h)
