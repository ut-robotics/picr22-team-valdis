=== Saturday 2022-09-03
*Markus:* Attended bootcamp

=== Sunday 2022-09-04
*Karl:* Started work on testrobot electronics and assisted with initial NUC setup. (3h)

*Virco:* Installed Ubuntu and setup NUC to open without the need of direct input. (2h)

*Markus:* Worked with Virco to help setup NUC to specified requierments. (2h)

=== Tuesday 2022-09-06
*Kevin:* Added VNC connection capability to NUC. MacOS didn't like VSC SSH connection. Will try SSH again on later date. (2h)

*Karl:* Continued soldering electronics. Discovered burnt capacitor on motor board. (2h)

=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Karl:* Finished soldering testrobot electronics and changed out burnt capacitor. Will test motors later this week. (3h)

*Markus:* Continued debugging SSH connection. Static connection settings didn't work (MacOS wasn't the problem). Will attempt to fix later this week. (2h)

=== Tuesday 2022-09-13
*Karl:* Minor fixes to testrobot electronics. Positioned components and wires better. Ran into a problem with Hterm motor testing. Will make second attempt later in the week. (2.5h)
        
*Kevin:* Got a stable remote connection with the added ability to have other members connect to Valids from their homes(if not present). (2.5h)

*Markus:* Worked with Kevin to get remote connection up and running. (2.5h)

=== Sunday 2022-09-18
*Kevin:* Tested different ball detection methods to determine best one (2h)

=== Monday 2022-09-19
*Everyone:* Progress presentation (1.5h)

=== Thursday 2022-09-22
*Karl:* Test robot components tested and all working with external powersupply. Assembled robot. Have to extend battery connector and clean up wires a bit. (2.5h)

=== Monday 2022-09-26
*Karl:* Minor fixes to testrobot. Discovered possible issue with wheel motor encoder (working for now). Remounted camera. Helped with programming. (2.5h)

*Virco:* Discussed thrower design with instructors. Will make adjustments to design for revision. (2h)

*Markus:* Tested different camera settings for ball and court detection. (2.5h)

*Arnold:* Tested different camera settings for ball and court detection. (2h)

=== Wednesday 2022-09-28
*Karl:* Got mainboard-NUC communications working and the testrobot is capable of moving on it's own. Experimented with pyrealsense2 library to implement depth sensor. Worked on PCB schematic. (4h)

*Markus:* Helped set up mainboard communication with NUC. (2h)

=== Thursday 2022-09-29
*Virco:* Finished thrower design and showed to instructors. Waiting to be cut and assembled. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on schematic and object distance measuring with realsense camera. (4h)

=== Saturday 2022-10-01
*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1.5h)

=== Monday 2022-10-03
*Markus:* Progress presentation (2h)

=== Wednesday 2022-10-05
*Markus:* Tested moving with serial and struct (2h)

*Arnold:* Tested moving with serial and struct (2h)

=== Monday 2022-10-10
*Mechanics:* Virco left the course. New mechanics are Karl and Kevin.

*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1.5h)

=== Tuesday 2022-10-11
*Kevin:* Tested remote control integration. Successfully moved robot forward with remote control. Will add more functionality on a later date. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1h)

=== Friday 2022-10-14
*Kevin:* Added more functionality to moving robot with controller. (2h)

*Markus:* Made game logic diagram to establish tasks to work on. Optimized movement. (2h)

*Arnold:* Made game logic diagram to establish tasks to work on. Optimized movement. (2h)

=== Sunday 2022-10-16
*Kevin:* Added more functionality to moving robot with controller. (2h)

=== Monday 2022-10-17
*Arnold:* Progress presentation. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on fixing thrower design from feedback. Progress presentation. (3h)

=== Thursday 2022-10-20
*Karl:* Continued work on thrower design. Also started second design with adjustable thrower angle. (5h)

=== Friday 2022-10-28
*Karl:* Finished thrower fabrication and added thrower to robot. Thrower motor needs more grip.  Also helped with ball following algorithm.  (4h)

*Markus:* Worked on robot-ball lineup algorithm. Tested throwing capability. (4h)

*Kevin:* Worked on controller, added mapped a throw button. Helped with ball following algorithm. (4h)

=== Sunday 2022-10-30
*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (3h)

=== Monday 2022-10-31
*Markus:* Tuned color mapping and movement after detection. (1h)

*Karl:* Mapped linear thrower controls and added 2-speed controls for movement with controller. (1h)

=== Tuesday 2022-11-01
*Markus:* Worked on fine tuning movement. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on two different omniwheel designs, one with 3D printed large rollers and one with small metal rollers. Will discuss which option to further pursue. (2h)

=== Friday 2022-11-04
*Karl:* Finished wheel design revision. Finished motor mount and camera mount (top and bottom plates are about 80% complete for initial design). Will get measurements for batteries and thrower voltage regulator over the weekend. Will also start work on an updated thrower design (current throw angle is a bit too steep). Completed new chassis design to be expected by Monday. Will also work on finishing schematic over the weekend to start work on PCB by next week. Also had idea for fixed battery sockets but won't concentrate on those at this time. (7h)

=== Sunday 2022-11-06
*Kevin and Arnold:* Did adjustments to the orbiting. Valdis will orbit around the ball until the ball is directly in the path of the basket. Once the adequate conditions are met valdis will pick up the ball and shoot. (Next up on the todo is to adjust the throwing angle and motor speed)(Also need to fix the startup ball finding procedure, if the robot sees no ball at initial startup the program will crash). (3h)

=== Monday 2022-11-07
*Karl:* Worked on new chassis and schematic. (3h)
*Markus:* Started building omnimotion. (3h)

=== Tuesday 2022-11-08
*Karl:* Adjusted new thrower design so that ramp walls are closer together. Printed new wheels. Made modifications to thrower motor support piece. (5h)

*Kevin:* Worked on omnimotion. (4h)

*Markus:* Worked on omnimotion. (5h)

=== Wednesday 2022-11-09

*Markus:* Worked on ball following orbiting and throwing (8h)

*Kevin:* Worked on ball following orbiting and throwing (6h)

=== Thursday 2022-11-10
