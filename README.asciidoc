== Running the code

The code was run on Python 3.9.13

clone the repo -> open up the file config_colors.py and use the macros to establish the balls, baskets and court ->  finally run omni_main
if you also want it to work with a referee then in the end run main_uwu but change lines 86 and 87 to fit your current environment
