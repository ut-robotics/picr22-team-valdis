=== Saturday 2022-09-03
*Markus:* Attended bootcamp

=== Sunday 2022-09-04
*Karl:* Started work on testrobot electronics and assisted with initial NUC setup. (3h)

*Virco:* Installed Ubuntu and setup NUC to open without the need of direct input. (2h)

*Markus:* Worked with Virco to help setup NUC to specified requierments. (2h)

=== Tuesday 2022-09-06
*Kevin:* Added VNC connection capability to NUC. MacOS didn't like VSC SSH connection. Will try SSH again on later date. (2h)

*Karl:* Continued soldering electronics. Discovered burnt capacitor on motor board. (2h)

=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Karl:* Finished soldering testrobot electronics and changed out burnt capacitor. Will test motors later this week. (3h)

*Markus:* Continued debugging SSH connection. Static connection settings didn't work (MacOS wasn't the problem). Will attempt to fix later this week. (2h)

=== Tuesday 2022-09-13
*Karl:* Minor fixes to testrobot electronics. Positioned components and wires better. Ran into a problem with Hterm motor testing. Will make second attempt later in the week. (2.5h)
        
*Kevin:* Got a stable remote connection with the added ability to have other members connect to Valids from their homes(if not present). (2.5h)

*Markus:* Worked with Kevin to get remote connection up and running. (2.5h)

=== Sunday 2022-09-18
*Kevin:* Tested different ball detection methods to determine best one (2h)

=== Monday 2022-09-19
*Everyone:* Progress presentation (1.5h)

=== Thursday 2022-09-22
*Karl:* Test robot components tested and all working with external powersupply. Assembled robot. Have to extend battery connector and clean up wires a bit. (2.5h)

=== Monday 2022-09-26
*Karl:* Minor fixes to testrobot. Discovered possible issue with wheel motor encoder (working for now). Remounted camera. Helped with programming. (2.5h)

*Virco:* Discussed thrower design with instructors. Will make adjustments to design for revision. (2h)

*Markus:* Tested different camera settings for ball and court detection. (2.5h)

*Arnold:* Tested different camera settings for ball and court detection. (2h)

=== Wednesday 2022-09-28
*Karl:* Got mainboard-NUC communications working and the testrobot is capable of moving on it's own. Experimented with pyrealsense2 library to implement depth sensor. Worked on PCB schematic. (4h)

*Markus:* Helped set up mainboard communication with NUC. (2h)

=== Thursday 2022-09-29
*Virco:* Finished thrower design and showed to instructors. Waiting to be cut and assembled. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on schematic and object distance measuring with realsense camera. (4h)

=== Saturday 2022-10-01
*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1.5h)

=== Monday 2022-10-03
*Markus:* Progress presentation (2h)

=== Wednesday 2022-10-05
*Markus:* Tested moving with serial and struct (2h)

*Arnold:* Tested moving with serial and struct (2h)

=== Monday 2022-10-10
*Mechanics:* Virco left the course. New mechanics are Karl and Kevin.

*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1.5h)

=== Tuesday 2022-10-11
*Kevin:* Tested remote control integration. Successfully moved robot forward with remote control. Will add more functionality on a later date. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (1h)

=== Friday 2022-10-14
*Kevin:* Added more functionality to moving robot with controller. (2h)

*Markus:* Made game logic diagram to establish tasks to work on. Optimized movement. (2h)

*Arnold:* Made game logic diagram to establish tasks to work on. Optimized movement. (2h)

=== Sunday 2022-10-16
*Kevin:* Added more functionality to moving robot with controller. (2h)

=== Monday 2022-10-17
*Arnold:* Progress presentation. (2h)

*Karl:* Worked on fixing thrower design from feedback. Progress presentation. (3h)

=== Thursday 2022-10-20
*Karl:* Continued work on thrower design. Also started second design with adjustable thrower angle. (5h)

=== Friday 2022-10-28
*Karl:* Finished thrower fabrication and added thrower to robot. Thrower motor needs more grip.  Also helped with ball following algorithm.  (4h)

*Markus:* Worked on robot-ball lineup algorithm. Tested throwing capability. (4h)

*Kevin:* Worked on controller, added mapped a throw button. Helped with ball following algorithm. (4h)

=== Sunday 2022-10-30
*Karl:* Worked on schematic. (3h)

=== Monday 2022-10-31
*Markus:* Tuned color mapping and movement after detection. (1h)

*Karl:* Mapped linear thrower controls and added 2-speed controls for movement with controller. (1h)
