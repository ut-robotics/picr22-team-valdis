*Karl:* Continued soldering electronics. Discovered burnt capacitor on motor board. (2h)

=== Monday 2022-09-12
*Karl:* Finished soldering testrobot electronics and changed out burnt capacitor. Will test motors later this week. (3h)

*Markus:* Continued debugging SSH connection. Static connection settings didn't work (MacOS wasn't the problem). Will attempt to fix later this week. (2h)

=== Tuesday 2022-09-13
*Karl:* Minor fixes to testrobot electronics. Positioned components and wires better. Ran into a problem with Hterm motor testing. Will make second attempt later in the week. (2.5h)
        
*Kevin:* Got a stable remote connection with the added ability to have other members connect to Valids from their homes(if not present). (2.5h)
